## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a structured approach for understanding your data that can be used for research question and hypothesis development. EDA's overall objective is to get insights to make better decisions. Sub-objectives include:

- Identify correlated variables.
- Identify and deal with outliers.
- Identify trends across time.
- Identify trends across space. 
- Uncover patterns related to the response variable of interest.
- Create research questions to explore or hypotheses to test.
- Identify possible new data sources.

## Set-Up Environment

The .RDS file loaded below was generated using the script "code/0_get_data.R". 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidy_data <- readRDS("data/2023-02-24-tidy_data.RDS")
```

## About the Variables

* subjectkey is the subject's unique identifier.
* eventname is the data collection point for an observation (row of data). Note, interview_age is also available in months.
* Brain structure metrics cortical thickness (thick) and surface area (area) are included. For more on the meaning of these metrics, see https://doi-org.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/10.1007%2Fs00429-015-1177-6

First, we will split our data by eventname to study it cross-sectionally for now.

```{r}
table(tidy_data$eventname)
split_data = split(tidy_data, f = tidy_data$eventname)
baseline_data = split_data$baseline_year_1_arm_1 %>% ungroup
baseline_smri = select(baseline_data, starts_with("smri"))
```

Now, I'll look into the age distributions of those with imaging data at baseline and year 2.

```{r}
tidy_data %>% 
  select(subjectkey, interview_age, eventname) %>%
  group_by(subjectkey)
```

## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

For Principal Components Analysis (PCA), [the R function `prcomp()` is preferred](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/20101/what-is-the-difference-between-r-functions-prcomp-and-princomp). Note, the loadings are accessible in the resulting object's rotation feature.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pca-analysis-r
library(ggcorrplot)
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
# check for NAs
colSums(is.na(baseline_smri)) %>% sum
# normalize and consider correlations
baseline_smri_normalized = scale(baseline_smri)
corr_matrix = cor(baseline_smri_normalized)
ggcorrplot(corr_matrix)
# PCA
pca <- prcomp(baseline_smri_normalized) 
fviz_eig(pca, addlabels = TRUE)
fviz_pca_var(pca, col.var = "black")
# contribution to first 2 components
fviz_cos2(pca, choice = "var", axes = 1:2) 
fviz_pca_var(pca, col.var = "cos2",
            gradient.cols = c("black", "orange", "green"),
            repel = TRUE)
```

### Principal Components Regression (PCR)

Next we perform regression and classification against a clinical severity score and a binary clinical outcome respectively using principal components identified in the PCA above and covariates. 

Note, in fits, I'm receiving "Warning: Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.00427516 (tol = 0.002, component 1)".

```{r}
# TODO: use lmer to account for fixed/ random effects, control for site effect and family within site
library(lme4)

outcome_of_interest <- "outcome_internalizing_score"
outcome_names <- c("outcome_si", "outcome_internalizing_score")
outcome_to_remove <- subset(outcome_names, outcome_names!=outcome_of_interest)

base_model_data <- baseline_data %>%
  select(-starts_with("smri")) %>%
  # choose and rename outcome of interest
  select(-c("subjectkey", "eventname", all_of(outcome_to_remove))) %>%
  rename(outcome = starts_with("outcome"))

var_names <- colnames(base_model_data)

random_effect_index <- which(var_names  %in% c("abcd_site", "rel_family_id"))
outcome_index <- which(var_names == "outcome")

base_fixed_effects <- var_names[-c(random_effect_index, outcome_index)] %>% paste(collapse = "+")
base_formula <- paste0("outcome~", base_fixed_effects, "+(1|abcd_site/rel_family_id)")


# TODO: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22988/how-to-obtain-the-p-value-check-significance-of-an-effect-in-a-lme4-mixed-mode

# compute a model where the effect of PC is not estimated
restricted_fit = lmer( 
  data = base_model_data,
  formula = base_formula, 
  REML = F #because we want to compare models on likelihood
)

fits <- list(restricted_fit)

for (i in 1:10) {
  print(paste("Model",i-1,"fitting"))
  pc_index <- seq(1, i)
  if (i==1) {
    model_data <- base_model_data %>%
      cbind(PC1=pca$x[,pc_index]) # TODO: Find a substitute for this if else
  } else {
    model_data <- base_model_data %>%
      cbind(pca$x[,pc_index])
  }
  pc_names <- paste0("PC", pc_index, collapse = "+")
  model_formula <- paste(base_formula, pc_names, sep = "+")
  # compute a model where the effect of an additional PC is estimated
  fits[[i+1]] = lmer( 
    data = model_data,
    formula = model_formula, 
    REML = F #because we want to compare models on likelihood
  )
}

lapply(fits, summary)

likelihood_ratios <- list()
for (i in 1:10) {
  unrestricted_fit <- fits[[i]]
  restricted_fit <- fits[[i+1]]
  # compute the AIC-corrected log-base-2 likelihood ratio (a.k.a. "bits" of evidence)
  likelihood_ratios[[i]] <- (AIC(restricted_fit)-AIC(unrestricted_fit))*log2(exp(1))
}

likelihood_ratios

# classification_data <- model_data %>%
#   select(-c("subjectkey","eventname","outcome_internalizing_score")) %>%
#   rename(outcome = outcome_si)
# classification_fit <- glmer(model_formula, data = classification_data, family = binomial)
# summary(classification_fit)
```

### Principal Component Loading Plots

Now, let's make plots of the first ten principal components' thickness loading minus surface area loading. Thus, 

* a region with a more positive value is more represented by cortical thickness, 
* a region with a near zero value is represented by both cortical thickness and surface area, and 
* a region with a more negative value is more represented by surface area. 

Consider, Is a given PC representing variance in certain regions? Is a given PC more dominated by thickness or surface area?

```{r}
library(ggseg) # https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021-03-14-new-ggseg-with-geom/

plot_pc_relative_loadings <- function(pc) {
  pc_thick_index <- which(names(pc) %>% str_detect("thick"))
  pc_thick <- pc[pc_thick_index]
  pc_area <- pc[-pc_thick_index]
  regions <- dk$data %>% 
    filter(region != "corpus callosum") %>% 
    pull(region) %>% na.omit %>% unique %>% sort
  df <- data.frame(hemi=c(rep("left", length(regions)), 
                          rep("right", length(regions))),
                   region=rep(regions, 2), 
                   loading=pc_thick-pc_area, 
                   row.names = NULL)
  ggplot(df) + geom_brain(atlas = dk, 
               position = position_brain(hemi ~ side),
               aes(fill = loading)) + theme_brain2()
}

pc_plots <- apply(pca$rotation[,1:10], 2, plot_pc_relative_loadings)
pc_plots
```

## Questions

* What other covariates are required?
* Do we want to use eventname or interview age for temporal effect?
