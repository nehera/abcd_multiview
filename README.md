# abcd_multiview
This repository is for a multiview analysis of data from the [ABCD StudyÂ®](https://abcdstudy.org/). It represents a collaboration of University of Minnesota Biostatistics & Health Data Science researchers Aidan Neher, Mark Fiecas, Thierry Chekouo, and Sandra Safo.

The repository includes reports as .RMD/ .pdf files at its file tree's top level. Code, images, and presentations are included in subdirectories. Data referenced in the code is housed locally in a subdirectory "data". Note, the .gitignore file prevents any data from getting pushed to GitHub with the inclusion of the line "data/*", so if you aim to recreate any analyses, you will need to put the appropriate data into your environment.
